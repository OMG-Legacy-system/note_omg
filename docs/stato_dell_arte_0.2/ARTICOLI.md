### [The effect of 3D visualization on mainframe application maintenance: A controlled experiment](https://www.scopus.com/pages/publications/85015829702?origin=resultslist)

The proposed system aims at establishing a static 3D call graph
model for COBOL programs using virtual reality modeling language. It receives the file having the function source code from
the end user and establishes all functions and sub functions called
by that function as a 3D model using VRML.

### [A demand-driven approach to slicing legacy COBOL systems](https://www.scopus.com/pages/publications/84863322306?origin=resultslist)
This paperproposes a novel static program slicing approach, which is based on context-sensitive token propagationover control ﬂow graphs (CFGs). CFGs require less space compared with program dependence graphs(PDGs) used by other techniques, and the token propagation method computes the necessary informationonly, on demand. Algorithms are presented for data ﬂow and full slicing to calculate precise program slices.Preliminary application experiences on industrial-scale COBOL systems are also summarized

### [Mining Association Rules from Code (MARC) to support legacy software management](https://www.scopus.com/pages/publications/85077041210?origin=resultslist)
Mining association rules from code (MARC) is a software engineering technique that analyzes source code to identify patterns, dependencies, and relationships between program entities.
This paper presents a methodology for Mining Association Rules from Code (MARC),
aiming at capturing program structure, facilitating system understanding and supporting
software management

# Migration Strategies
### [Bottom-up and top-down cobol system migration to web services](https://www.scopus.com/pages/publications/84875739471?origin=resultslist)
Moving from mainframe systems to a service-oriented architecture (SOA)
using Web services is an attractive but daunting task. The bottom-up or directmigration approach enables the effective modernization of legacy systems to
Web services. Conversely, bringing migration into fruition with the top-down
or indirect-migration approach is more difficult, but it achieves better migration
results. Employing both approaches on the same large enterprise system is
uncommon, which leaves no room for comparison. This article describes the
migration processes, costs, and outcomes of applying both approaches on a
real Cobol system.

## Re-Ingegnerizzazione
### [Agile model-driven re-engineering](https://www.scopus.com/pages/publications/85196291052?origin=resultslist)
The objective is to support the reuse of business-critical functionality from such systems and the porting of legacy
code to modernised platforms, together with technical debt reduction to improve the system maintainability and extend
its useful life. AMDRE uses a lightweight MDE process which involves the automated abstraction of software systems
to UML specifications and the interactive application of refactoring and rearchitecting transformations to remove quality
flaws and architectural flaws

L'articolo è in spagnolo, comunque parla di sistemi di migrazione diretta e indiretta, nel caso dalla tabella qualcosa si può recuperare
