### [Leveraging LLMs for Automated Translation of Legacy Code: A Case Study on PL/SQL to Java Transformation](https://www.scopus.com/pages/publications/105027178802?origin=resultslist)
The VT legacy system, comprising approximately 2.5 million lines of PL/SQL code, lacks consistent documentation and automated tests, posing significant challenges for refactoring and modernisation. This study investigates the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to assist in translating PL/SQL code into Java for the modernised "VTF3"system. By leveraging a dataset comprising 10 PL/SQL-to-Java code pairs and 15 Java classes, which collectively established a domain model for the translated files, multiple LLMs were evaluated. Furthermore, we propose a customized prompting strategy that integrates chain-of-guidance reasoning with n-shot prompting.

### [Formal Verification of Transcompiled Mobile Applications Using First-Order Logic](https://www.scopus.com/pages/publications/105026452126?origin=resultslist)
#### Nel paper viene specificato che il framework è language-agnostic
The increasing interest in automated code conversion and transcompilation—driven by the need to support multiple platforms efficiently—has raised new challenges in verifying that translated codes preserve the intended behaviors of the originals. Although it has not yet been widely adopted, transcompilation offers promising applications in software reuse and cross-platform migration. With the growing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code translation, where internal reasoning remains inaccessible, verifying the equivalence of their generated outputs has become increasingly essential.
